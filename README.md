# ACM-Code-of-Ethics-1-Page-PDF
_A 1-page PDF that contains the new ACM Code of Ethics_

As I started prepping for courses this semester, I went looking for a 1-page version of [ACM's new code of ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics). I couldn't find anything that was easy to post on my wall, so I went out and made one. I've included the Adobe InDesign file + the PDF in this repository. 

- [Just download the PDF](https://github.com/evanpeck/ACM-Code-of-Ethics-1-Page-PDF/raw/master/acm_ethics_1sheet.pdf)

**Disclaimer:** I'm not a designer and I don't pretend to be. My hope is that someone runs with this and makes a 1-pager that is prettier and easier to read than this one. Until then, enjoy!

If you happen to use this somewhere, _please let me know_. I'd love to keep track. You can [email me](mailto:evan.peck@bucknell.edu) or [tell me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/EvanMPeck)
